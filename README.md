Billiards
=========

Billiards is a time travel-themed game of pool in which pockets act as portals to each other through time and space. For example, if a ball enters pocket 1 at time t=10, it could emerge from pocket 2 at time t=5, so a ball can it itself out of its own way, causing a paradox. This is a demonstration of the [Novikov self-consistency principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle). Billiards is written in Java with dyn4j and Slick2D.
